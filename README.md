# GratingSpectrometer_2019
The prototype of a grating spectrometer based on the Czerny-Turner structure for a high-speed communication system.
# Objective
Design a spectrometer for high-speed optical communication systems. The structure can refer to the Czeny-Turner structure. The spectral range is within 1250nm-1650nm. The resolution should be ≤ 0.5nm.
# Detailed requirements
1. Reference structure: Czeny-Turner Structure.
2. Spectral Range: 1250nm-1650nm.
3. Resolution: ≤ 0.5nm.
